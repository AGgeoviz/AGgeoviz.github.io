While it is convenient to edit .py files in a text editor, it is much more convenient to edit .html files directly in github and 
save back-up copies to a local computer from time to time.

Bear in mind that our mapbox username is "adaptgeo" whereas our github username is "aggeoviz"

This index.html file is used to link to other .html files, each of which corresponds to one GI toolkit output

To create a new tileset .html, select "Add File" then "Create New File" then Enter Code and Save as .html
	Webpage URL:  https://aggeoviz.github.io/(filename).html

I'm sure there's a way to automate tileset name extraction, but for the meantime, a convenient way to grab the tilest name 
is to right-click on its name in mapbox studio and select "Search google for..." then copy from the address bar and paste into html

Since there is lag in posting html to github, a faster way to proof-read code is to run a local web server and open the HTML 
file in my browser. For example, using Python's built-in HTTP server:

    In the command shell:

		Navigate to the directory containing HTML file and execute the following command:
		
			python -m http.server

        Then open web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/yourfile.html.
